Instructions on how to run Motion_Estimation_and_Visualisation.ipynb:

1. The monkey video (monkey.avi) should be placed in the main folder if not already there.
2. The code that converts the video to frames should produce a folder named "frames" (if it doesn't already exist) and store the frames there.
3. The code that generates the output should produce a folder named "output" (if it doesn't already exist) and store the output frames there.
4. The current threshold limits are 112 and 150 for the minimum and maximum respectively. The threshold can be adjusted as desired for higher or lower filtering of noise.
5. The code is set to output 150 frames. You can change the frame_counter and count variables to read in the desired amount of frames.
